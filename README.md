# Vulnerability Alerter

Group Members: Eric Kim, Aaron Liu, Jinwoo Kim

## Project Description
For our final project, we will be creating a full stack web application that notifies the users of any new vulnerabilities in dependencies and libraries they use. This web application is primarily targeted towards developers and system administrators who may want to keep their applications up to date and reduce organizational security risks. There are vulnerability scanners and patch management systems out there that automatically remediates new application vulnerabilities. However, scanners have latencies, and automated patches could often result in cascading failures and unforeseen conflicts. With our application, the users could provide us with “dependency definition files,” such as package.json for Node.js, or register individual libraries to set up alerts. Then, they could investigate and respond accordingly based on instant vulnerability alerts, gain information about new exploits, and keep their applications safe. We, as developers, want to build this application because we often use dependency-laden frameworks and we share the responsibility of keeping customer data safe. By using our application, we will become more security conscious, and patch up the applications and systems that we build to better protect data from cyber threats.

## Documentation

### Full Stack Application
> When running the full-stack application, the frontend production build is created, so the hot loading feature will be disabled.

To run full-stack web application in production mode, run the following command: `npm run prod`

To run full-stack web application in development mode, run the following command: `npm run dev`

- - - 
### Frontend
To run the frontend application in development mode, run the following command: `npm run frontend`

- - - 
### Backend
To run the backend server in production mode, run the following command: `npm run backend`

To run the backend server in development mode, run the following command: `npm run backend-dev`
